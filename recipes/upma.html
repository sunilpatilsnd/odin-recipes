    <h3 class="script_head">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="script">
        <li>Heat Oil/Ghee: In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee. </li>
        <li>Temper Mustard Seeds and Urad Dal: Add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and 1 teaspoon of urad dal to the hot oil. Allow them to splutter.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add finely chopped onions (1 medium-sized), green chilies (2-3, chopped), and a few curry leaves. Sauté until the onions become golden brown.</li>
        <li>Roast Semolina (Rava): Add 1 cup of semolina (rava) to the mixture. Roast the semolina on low to medium heat until it emits a nutty aroma and turns slightly golden. This step is crucial for flavor.</li>
        <li>Boil Water: Meanwhile, in a separate pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Gradually Add Water: Slowly pour the hot water into the roasted semolina, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Be cautious as it may splutter.</li>
        <li>Season and Simmer: Season with salt to taste. Reduce the heat to low and let the Upma simmer. Cover the pan and cook for 5-7 minutes or until the Upma reaches a porridge-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Optional: Add Vegetables: For a nutritious variation, you can add boiled or sautéed vegetables like peas, carrots, or diced bell peppers during the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with coconut chutney, pickle, or yogurt.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious and comforting Upma!</li>
